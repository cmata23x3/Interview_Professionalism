        <h1>During the Interview <small>Successful Performance</small></h1>
        <p class="lead">Now that you have gotten the interview and prepared yourself well, it's the big day and like the pizza man on Saturday nights, it's time to deliver. It's showtime, the interviewer is here and it's your time to shine. Here are some tips and ideas to keep in mind as you go into your interview.</p>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Image Presentation <span class="text-muted">Sell your skils, talents and yourself</span></h3>
          <p>You've gotten to the interview and now you have to present the best image of yourself. Remember to speak of your high points, acknowledge your weaknesses and present a person that they'd enjoy working with for an extended period of time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a passion and intensity for the job you're interviewing for and convey that.
              <ul>
                <li>Show why you're genuinely interested in this job and how you and the company can mutually benefit from this potential employment. </li>
                <li>Be cognizant of the impression you give off. Don't let the interviewer think you're arrogant. There's a difference between cocky and confident.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remember they're interviewing you because they'll have to work with you. Be the person that they wouldn't mind having around everyday for at least 8 hours.</li>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">The Questioning <span class="text-muted">Soft-skill, Behavioral & Technical Questions</span></h3>
          <p>With the greetings done, it's time for the focus of the interview: the questioning. The interviewer is here to ask questions to get a better understanding. Use this as a time to display your behavioral and analytical skills.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For behavioral and soft-skill questions like "Tell us a time you had difficulties in a group." or "What your is your biggest weakness?", follow the STAR Technique to give a well thoughtout answer.</li>
            <li>On technical questions, convey as much as possible as you work through your questions.
              <ul>
                <li>One of the biggest reasons for technical questions is for the interviewer to gain some insight on how you think, so <strong>keep talking</strong> and explaining your thought process.</li>
                <li>Avoid long periods of silence if at all possible.</li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>Don't BS the interviewer.
                <ul>
                  <li>If you do not know something, just say it. It's better to show that you're honest and willing to ask for help rather than a liar.</li>
                </ul>
