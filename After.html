        <h1>After the Interview <small>Following Up on Success</small></h1>
        <p class="lead">Mission Accomplished? Not yet, my friend. Although the interview is done and in the books, there are a couple items left on your agenda to follow up on. Like a second doctors appointment, here's some advice on following up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row featurette" id="topRow">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Follow Up Letter <span class="text-muted">Leave a Final Message</span></h3>
          <p>Now that the interview is over and you've left, you have another opportunity to reach out to the interviewer. Remember that they have to give feedback on how your interview went, so before they do that send a follow-up email.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Depending on your feelings after the interview, express your continued intersted in the company or the opposite if you've had a change of heart. 
              <ul>
                <li>From what you were able to gather from the interviewer, maybe you are more interested in the company now.</li>
                <li>Either way, remember to be courteous and polite.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remember to thank the interviewer for their time and for sharing their knowledge.
              <ul>
                <li>Keep in mind that doing interviews may not be their only job, so thank them.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Follow-Up emails won't get you the job, but they help reaffirm if you do.
              <ul>
                <li>If the interviewer already has a good impression from you and feels like you would work well within their company, a follow-up email is a classy move to reinforce that feeling.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">What's Next? <span class="text-muted">Moving on Up or Moving On</span></h3>
          <p>Congrats! You've completed your interview and left the best impression possible. So what do expect now? There's a few things that can happen. Depending on the company and their interview process, you could move onto the next round of interviews or you could be extended an offer to work for their company. The other possibility is that the company decides that they do not have a position for you, but do not let this discourage you. There are many more interviews to had!</p>
