          <p>The beginning of your path for interviewing is writing a resume, a straight-forward, single page snapshot of your education, experiences, skills and achievements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't make your resume too long.
              <ul>
                <li>If you're not a Ph.D. candidate, choose the most important information and keep to one page.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When writing your work experience, give short desciption below it that entails some of the tasks you undertook.
              <ul>
                  <li>Showcase what you've worked on and done and always lead with a action verb.</li>
                  <li>For example, "Produced an Excel document to manage store inventory"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do use technical buzzwords. 
              <ul>
                <li>"Python", "Java", etc. These words help when employers are searching through resumes.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Try and avoid adjectives.
              <ul>
                <li>For example, "Prestigious awards." Don't overwhelm the employer with grandiose terms.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Be prepared by obvious weaknesses that you may have in your resume. 
              <ul>
                <li>Although you may not like to think so, if something is left off your resume, be prepared to possibly discuss it during the actual interview.</li>
                <li>A common example would be if your Grade Point Average is a bit below average and you decide to leave it off, don't be caught off guard if the interviewer asks about it.</li>
              </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Rule of Thumb: Never dress less than the attaire that you'd expect your interviewer to be wearing.
              <ul>
                  <li>If you're interviewing at a Fortune 500 company and you expect your interviewer to be wearing a full suit, then suit up as well.</li>
                  <li>If you think it may be a bit more casual, a dress shirt and slacks will do, but never should the interviewer be in a more formal attaire than you.</li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>Be punctual and courteous.
            <ul>
                <li>It's never a good start when you're late to your interview, so plan ahead and make sure you get there with time to spare.</li>
                <li>When finally meeting your interviewer, be polite, speak clearly, give a firm handshake, and always look them in the eye when speaking. These are a few things that will give you an air of confidence.</li>
